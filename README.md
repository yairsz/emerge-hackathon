Registering Your Team
---------------------

To register your team [fork this repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/),
add your team to the list of teams in this `README.md` file
and make a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests)
so we can pull the changes back into our repository.

To add your team to the list,
just add a line under the *Teams* heading like this one:

```md
- [Your Project Name](https://github.com/you/your-project) by Your Team
```

You need to put your **project's name** inside the square brackets,
your **project's repository URL** inside the parentheses
and your **team's name** after *by*.
If you need help with the pull request process,
flag down [this bearded guy](https://twitter.com/khalifenizar).

In addition, your project repository's README file should have:

- **Description of the project**
- **Technologies used**
- **Team member names**
- **Team member e-mail addresses**
- **Team member Twitter URLs** (or URLs for other Internet profiles)

See the [example project README](example-project-readme.md) to get an idea of what it should look like.
